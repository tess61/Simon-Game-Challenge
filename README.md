# Simon Game Challenge

This is a simple Simon Game project, developed as part of an online course on Udemy. The game challenges players to remember and repeat an increasing sequence of colors.

## Project Structure
```plaintext
The project directory contains the following files:
Simon Game Challenge/ 
  ├── sounds/ # Folder containing audio files for game sounds 
  ├── game.js # JavaScript logic for the game 
  ├── index.html # HTML structure for the game
  └── styles.css # CSS styling for the game
```
## How to Play

1. The game displays a sequence of colors (buttons) that light up one at a time. The sequence starts with one color and grows with each round.
2. Your task is to remember the sequence and click the colors in the same order.
3. Each correct sequence advances you to the next level.
4. The game ends if you click the wrong color in the sequence.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the game interface.
- **CSS**: Styling for the game elements.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, including sequence generation, user interaction, and level tracking.
- **Audio**: Sound effects are stored in the `sounds` folder and play during game interactions.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser to play the game.
